</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Hi! today I did an experiment: I compiled an Android App that has some java logic and shows the UI (button, view) using Flutter code. The project is in this <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/examples/platform_view">github repository</a></p>
<p>That project is basically a Flutter project, which internally, has a subfolder with the java code section of the app.</p>
<p>That app is pretty simple: The Flutter screen has a button that counts a number and another button to call a java Activity to show the result of the count. So to take this matter beyond the “hello world” example provided, I then changed the java part with the code of a previous java app I had, that takes control of the camera and applies OCR processing to the input video. After some adjustments I now have a Flutter app, that, when I press a button, opens a java activity and does OCR using the camera.</p>
<p>This opens and interesting possibility: having in the same mobile development project people (or teams) specialized in different layers: UI and “behind logic”. This actually happens frequently in software development projects and we call it “separate fronted from backend” logic. And now we can apply that same concept to a mobile app development project.</p>
<p>This may sound strange to some; but, if we consider the current state of matters (a huge amount of java code is about to become obsolete because kotlin is the new “star”) we need to find alternatives. And Flutter looks good because it allows us to make android apps with a modern style (and language) without losing legacy java code. Besides, there are lots of APIs and cloud services that tell us to download there java SDKs (yes, java, not kotlin) to work with them. Flutter also can connect to kotlin code so we are also covered in the future.</p>
<p>This separation of concerns has an extra advantage: there is no need to open Android Studio IDE to work on the Flutter side of the project, you just need a good editor like Visual Studio Code. This makes it easier for people with skills in QA, UI design, UI accessibility to work on that section of the project. And we have to admit those are skills not usually preferred by developers. So those kind of people can focus on that area of the application and make contributions there, without having to learn AndroidStudio or Kotlin. By the way, developers can still use AndroidStudio and Kotlin in a Flutter project. </p>                </article>
